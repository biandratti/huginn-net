# TLS Benchmark Analysis

This document provides detailed analysis of TLS processing performance using `huginn-net-tls` library. The benchmarks measure JA4 fingerprinting performance across different TLS packet types and processing levels.

## Test Data Overview

The benchmarks use two PCAP files containing real TLS traffic:

| PCAP File | Total Packets | TLS Packets | Effectiveness |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| tls12.pcap | 1 | 1 | 100% |
| tls-alpn-h2.pcap | 9 | 1 | 11% |

## Performance Results

### Core Processing Performance

| Operation | Time (microseconds) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Raw packet parsing | 0.003 | Structure validation only |
| Full TLS processing | 12.3 | Complete JA4 fingerprinting |
| TLS 1.2 processing | 10.9 | Standard TLS handshake |
| TLS ALPN H2 processing | 17.7 | With HTTP/2 extensions |

### Processing Overhead Analysis

| Comparison | Baseline | Target | Overhead | Impact |
|------------|----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Parsing vs Full Processing | 3.1 ns | 12.3 μs | 4,000x | Expected for cryptographic operations |
| TLS 1.2 vs ALPN H2 | 10.9 μs | 17.7 μs | 63% | Additional extension processing |
| Basic vs JA4 Access | 18.3 μs | 17.4 μs | -5% | JA4 pre-calculated during processing |

### Throughput Estimates

Based on single-core performance:

| Scenario | Packets/Second | Use Case |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| TLS 1.2 packets | ~91,700 | Standard TLS traffic |
| TLS ALPN H2 packets | ~56,500 | Modern HTTP/2 over TLS |
| Mixed TLS traffic | ~70,000 | Real-world average |

## Benchmark Categories

### 1. TLS Version Comparison
- **TLS_JA4_TLS12**: Standard TLS 1.2 handshake processing
- **TLS_JA4_ALPN_H2**: TLS with Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation for HTTP/2

### 2. Processing Level Analysis
- **raw_packet_parsing**: Basic packet structure validation
- **full_tls_processing**: Complete JA4 fingerprint generation
- **tls_with_result_extraction**: Full processing with result access

### 3. JA4 Calculation Overhead
- **basic_tls_processing**: Standard TLS analysis
- **ja4_fingerprint_access**: Accessing pre-calculated JA4 values
- **full_result_analysis**: Complete result collection and processing

## Key Findings

### Performance Characteristics

1. **Efficient Filtering**: The library can determine TLS packet validity in ~3 nanoseconds
2. **Reasonable JA4 Cost**: Complete JA4 fingerprinting takes 12-18 microseconds per packet
3. **Extension Impact**: ALPN and HTTP/2 extensions add ~63% processing overhead
4. **Lazy Evaluation**: JA4 fingerprints are calculated during initial processing, not on access

### Scalability Insights

1. **Real-time Analysis**: The library can handle high-throughput scenarios (70k+ packets/second)
2. **Memory Efficiency**: No significant overhead for result extraction
3. **Protocol Optimization**: TLS 1.2 processing is 40% faster than ALPN H2

## How to Reproduce

1. Ensure PCAP files are present in the `pcap/` directory:
   - `tls12.pcap`
   - `tls-alpn-h2.pcap`

2. Run the TLS-specific benchmark:
```bash
cargo bench --bench bench_tls
```

## Interpretation Guidelines

### For Network Security Applications
- The library provides excellent performance for real-time TLS fingerprinting
- JA4 generation latency (12-18μs) is suitable for high-speed network analysis
- Packet filtering efficiency (3ns) enables processing of high-volume traffic

### For Performance Optimization
- Pre-filtering non-TLS packets provides significant performance gains
- JA4 calculation overhead is front-loaded during initial processing

### For Capacity Planning
- Single-core throughput: 70,000+ TLS packets per second
- Memory usage: Minimal overhead for result storage
- CPU utilization: Primarily bound by cryptographic operations

## Technical Notes

- Benchmarks run in release mode with compiler optimizations
- Results measured using Criterion.rs with statistical analysis
- Outliers (5-9% of measurements) indicate consistent performance
- All timing measurements include complete JA4 fingerprint generation
- PCAP file effectiveness varies based on TLS handshake presence
