# HTTP Benchmark Analysis

This document provides detailed analysis of HTTP processing performance using `huginn-net-http` library. The benchmarks measure browser detection, web server identification, protocol analysis, and overall processing overhead across different HTTP scenarios.

## Test Data Overview

The benchmark uses an HTTP simple GET PCAP file containing real HTTP traffic:

| PCAP File | Total Packets | HTTP Analysis Results | Effectiveness |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|
| http-simple-get.pcap | 16 | 2 (1 Request + 1 Response) | 12.5% |

### Analysis Results Breakdown
- **HTTP requests**: 1 (Browser fingerprinting source)
- **HTTP responses**: 1 (Web server identification source)
- **Browser detections**: 1 (100% success rate on HTTP requests)
- **Server detections**: 1 (100% success rate on HTTP responses)
- **Protocol version**: HTTP/1.x only (no HTTP/2 traffic in this PCAP)

## Performance Results

### Core Processing Performance

| Operation | Time (microseconds) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Minimal packet parsing | 0.042 | Structure validation only |
| HTTP without browser matching | 32.0 | Basic HTTP analysis |
| HTTP with browser matching | 37.4 | Full browser fingerprinting |
| Server without matching | 33.1 | Basic server analysis |
| Server with matching | 37.3 | Full server identification |
| Full analysis with collection | 38.2 | Complete result processing |

### Processing Overhead Analysis

| Comparison | Baseline | Target | Overhead | Impact |
|------------|----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Parsing vs Full Analysis | 42 ns | 37.8 μs | 900x | Expected for comprehensive HTTP analysis |
| No Browser vs Browser Matching | 32.0 μs | 37.4 μs | 17% | Browser database lookup overhead |
| No Server vs Server Matching | 33.1 μs | 37.3 μs | 13% | Server database lookup overhead |
| Analysis vs Collection | 37.8 μs | 38.2 μs | 1% | Minimal result extraction overhead |

### Cache Size Impact Analysis

| Cache Size | Processing Time | Use Case |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| Small (100 flows) | 31.3 μs | Memory-constrained environments |
| Standard (1000 flows) | 31.6 μs | Typical HTTP monitoring |
| Large (10000 flows) | 30.8 μs | High-throughput analysis |

**Finding**: Flow cache size has minimal impact on performance (~1% variation), indicating efficient cache management.

### Throughput Estimates

Based on single-core performance:

| Scenario | Packets/Second | Use Case |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| Minimal parsing only | ~23,700,000 | High-speed packet filtering |
| Basic HTTP analysis | ~31,300 | HTTP flow analysis |

- **header_analysis**: Complete HTTP header parsing and analysis
- **small_flow_cache**: Performance with limited flow cache (100 entries)
- **large_flow_cache**: Performance with extended flow cache (10,000 entries)

### 4. Processing Overhead Comparison
- **minimal_processing**: Basic packet parsing and validation
- **full_http_analysis**: Complete HTTP analysis with all features enabled

## Key Findings

### Performance Characteristics

1. **Efficient Filtering**: Basic HTTP packet validation takes only ~46 nanoseconds
2. **Complex Analysis Cost**: Complete HTTP analysis requires 31-39 microseconds per packet
3. **Server Matching Overhead**: Server identification adds ~25% processing time
4. **Cache Efficiency**: Flow cache size has minimal performance impact (~1%)

### Scalability Insights

1. **Moderate Throughput**: Can process 25,000-32,000 packets/second with full analysis
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Flow cache scaling shows excellent memory management
3. **Protocol Optimization**: HTTP/1.x processing is well-optimized for header analysis

## How to Reproduce

1. Ensure PCAP file is present in the `pcap/` directory:
   - `http-simple-get.pcap`

2. Run the HTTP-specific benchmark:
```bash
cargo bench --bench bench_http
```

## Interpretation Guidelines

### For Network Security Applications
- The library provides good performance for HTTP fingerprinting applications
- Browser detection latency (35μs) is suitable for moderate-throughput monitoring
- Server identification (39μs) enables real-time web server analysis

### For Performance Optimization
- Server matching can be disabled when not needed (25% performance gain)
- Flow cache size optimization provides minimal performance benefits
- Consider selective feature enabling based on analysis requirements

### For Web Traffic Monitoring
- HTTP header analysis provides comprehensive application insights
- Protocol detection enables version-specific analysis capabilities
- Browser and server identification supports security and analytics use cases

### For Capacity Planning
- Single-core throughput: 26,800+ HTTP packets per second (full server detection)
- Browser detection throughput: 26,700+ packets per second
- Memory usage: Scales efficiently with flow cache size (100-10,000 flows)
- CPU utilization: Primarily bound by header parsing and database matching

## Technical Notes

- Benchmarks run in release mode with full compiler optimizations
- Results measured using Criterion.rs with statistical analysis
- Outliers (3-16% of measurements) indicate consistent performance patterns
- All timing measurements include complete HTTP analysis pipeline
- PCAP effectiveness varies based on HTTP request/response presence
- Flow cache uses TTL-based expiration for memory management
- Database matching uses optimized lookup structures for performance
- HTTP/1.x and HTTP/2 protocols supported with automatic detection

## HTTP Performance Summary

| Operation Type | Processing Time | Throughput (packets/sec) | Use Case |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------------|----------|
| Packet parsing | 46 ns | ~21,900,000 | High-speed filtering |
| Basic HTTP analysis | 31.6 μs | ~31,600 | Flow monitoring |
