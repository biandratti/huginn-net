**Huginn Net combines p0f TCP fingerprinting with JA4 TLS client analysis**, achieving the same detection accuracy as the original p0f tool while adding modern TLS fingerprinting capabilities. This Rust implementation has been thoroughly validated against real-world traffic and consistently delivers reliable fingerprinting results.

#### Why choose Huginn Net?

- **No system dependencies** - No tshark, wireshark, or external tools required
- **Same accuracy as p0f** - Validated against extensive device testing  
- **Modern Rust implementation** - Memory safety and zero-cost abstractions  
- **Production performance** - Processes packets in ~3.1ms with comparable speed to original p0f  
- **Type-safe architecture** - Prevents entire classes of bugs at compile time  
- **Comprehensive testing** - Full unit and integration test coverage  
- **Simple integration** - Single crate installation, no system dependencies
- **Active development** - Continuously improved and maintained  

#### What is Passive Traffic Fingerprinting?
Passive Traffic Fingerprinting is a technique that allows you to infer information about remote hosts and applications without sending any probes. By analyzing characteristics of the TCP/IP packets and TLS handshakes that are exchanged during normal network conversations, Huginn Net provides insights into:

- **Operating Systems** - Using p0f-inspired TCP fingerprinting to identify OS type, version, and network stack
- **Applications & Browsers** - Using HTTP headers and JA4 TLS client fingerprinting for precise application identification
- **Network Infrastructure** - Detecting intermediary devices, proxies, and load balancers
- **Client Capabilities** - TLS versions, cipher suites, and supported extensions

### Network Stack analysis supported by Huginn Net (OSI Model)

| Layer | Protocol / Feature        | Huginn Net Analysis                         |
|-------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 7     | TLS                       | JA4 (FoxIO-style)                           |
| 7     | HTTP                      | HTTP/1 & HTTP/2 - Headers, User-Agent, Lang |
| 4     | TCP                       | OS Fingerprinting (p0f-style)               |



#### Real-world applications:
- **Network Security Analysis** - Identify devices, applications, and TLS clients without active scanning
- **Asset Discovery** - Map network infrastructure and application stack passively and safely  
- **Threat Detection** - Detect hidden systems, suspicious TLS clients, and malicious applications
- **Application Monitoring** - Track browser types, versions, and TLS capabilities across networks
- **Research & Forensics** - Analyze traffic patterns, TLS usage, and improve security posture
- **Compliance Monitoring** - Track device types, OS versions, and TLS configurations

### **Which library should I use?**

- **Multi protocol scanning**: Use **[huginn-net](huginn-net/README.md)** for complete network analysis
- **TCP only**: Use **[huginn-net-tcp](huginn-net-tcp/README.md)** for OS detection and TCP analysis  
- **HTTP only**: Use **[huginn-net-http](huginn-net-http/README.md)** for browser and web server detection
- **TLS only**: Use **[huginn-net-tls](huginn-net-tls/README.md)** for JA4 fingerprinting and TLS analysis
- **Advanced**: Use `huginn-net-db` directly for custom signature parsing

### Matching Quality

Huginn Net provides intelligent quality scoring for all fingerprint matches, helping you assess the reliability of each detection.
The quality score is calculated based on the **distance** between observed network characteristics and known signatures.
To achieve the best quality in matching, a rich database will be needed.

#### Quality Metrics
- **Perfect Match (1.0)**: Exact signature match with zero distance
- **High Quality (0.8-0.95)**: Very close match with minimal differences
- **Medium Quality (0.6-0.8)**: Good match with some variations
- **Low Quality (0.4-0.6)**: Acceptable match but with notable differences
- **Poor Quality (<0.4)**: Weak match, use with caution
